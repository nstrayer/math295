Start by describing the paper and what is going on with the data. 

Explain that in S295 we just were handed data and told to do specific things to it. I want to go beyond that. A true data scientist isn’t nicely handed clean data, they must make it that way. 

Start with the first chromosome and recreate some plots from the paper. 

Walk through the hicups that came with the process of loading the data, including figuring out what the heck PLINK is. 

Once a few figures have been put up using the first chromosome bring in the full genome. 

Try and figure out the best way of plotting this. A manhattan plot most likely won’t work for 230,000 SNPs. What to do?
