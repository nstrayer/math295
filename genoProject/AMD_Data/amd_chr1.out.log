115360 (of 115360) markers to be included from [ amd.out_.map ]
Scan region on chromosome 1 from [ rs950122 ] to [ rs1782248 ]
146 individuals read from [ amd.out_.ped ] 
146 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
96 cases, 50 controls and 0 missing
69 males, 77 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 9178 SNPs
146 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.988739
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 9178 SNPs
